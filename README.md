**XML Base Configuration** :
XML can be used to configure all aspects of xFramium including the creation of the test cases! Click to read more:http://xframium.org/documentation/index.html


**Driver Configuration** :
The definition of a test suite starts with the driver configuration. From here all other aspects of xFramium can be configured in a single place for quick configuration changes. The driver configuration contains links and references to all other configuration files and test definitions and is made up of all of the elements below

**Test Script Management** :
xFramium users can define their test cases using the popular XML format. This format allows for many of the common programming structures and practices such as login and looping without needing to be a seasoned object oriented developer.

**Cloud Configuration** :
Configure and control access to all of your device groupings. Specify provider based clouds such as SauceLabs and Perfecto, local selenium grids and more.

**Application Configuration** :
Configure and control access to all of your applications and web sites. All applications, native, web and windows based are accessed and tested the same way with xFramium.

**Device Configuration** :
Once your cloud is configured you need to configure the devices. xFramium allows devices of different types from different clouds to all work together in a single test suite.

**Object Repository** :
xFramium has a very powerful object repository allowing for many mixed types of object locators to be mixed together. With xFramium all objects, regardless of their locator type can be stored in one place.

**Data Management** :
xFramium users can define their data structures for data driven testing in XML as well. Users can create simple data structures along with complex tree-like structures for complex testing scenarios.
